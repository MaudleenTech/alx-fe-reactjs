      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Our Story: Founded on the belief that digital access is a human right and a core driver of economic equality. Highlight the GCGO: Empowerment of Women mandate.

The Problem: Clearly state the text's problem: Systemic barriers, digital exclusion, and socio-economic inequalities prevent women from accessing technology, mentorship, and economic opportunities, deepening poverty and limiting national development.

Our Solution: Explain how EHT addresses the three pillars: Access (providing devices/connectivity), Education (digital literacy and vocational skills), and Opportunity (mentorship and job/entrepreneurial connection).

Team/Values: Emphasize commitment to Innovation, Equity, and Community-Led Solutions.
