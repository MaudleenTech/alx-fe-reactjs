# **Tailwind React Integration – User Profile Component**

This project focuses on integrating **Tailwind CSS** into a React application and applying utility-first styling, responsiveness, and interactivity to create a polished **User Profile** component.
It is part of the **ALX Frontend Development** weekly tasks.

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

The project involves:

* Setting up Tailwind CSS inside a React app.
* Styling a provided `UserProfile` component using Tailwind utility classes.
* Making the component fully responsive across screen sizes.
* Adding advanced interactivity such as hover effects, transitions, and animations.

By the end of this project, the styled `UserProfile` card displays an avatar, name, and bio—beautifully designed, responsive, and interactive.
